download composer
===================
https://getcomposer.org/download/

install packages (new project or running first time)
===================
delete:
vendor/

run:
composer install



autoload
===================
whenever you need to autoload a new dir run...

composer dump-autoload
or it that doesn't work use:
composer dump-autoload -o


update composer
===================
php composer.phar self-update

update to a certain version:
php composer.phar self-update 1.6.3

autoload
===================
in composer.json...
psr-4 is the most common and probably best type of autolaoding.
in this example, the Lib\Validation namespace maps to the folder lib/validation
if you require a class from this namespace like Lib\Validation\Validation_rule, composer
will look for the file lib/validation/Validation_rule.php with the class name in it: Validation_rule.
Need to capitalize the file name to let composer match it to the class name.
You don't have to match the folder structure to the namespace structure when using
psr-4 so you can map Lib\Validation to just lib if you want.

{
	"autoload": {
		"psr-4": {
			"Lib\\Validation\\": "lib/validation"
		}
	},
}
